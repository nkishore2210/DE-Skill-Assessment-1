TITLE:

Design and simulate octal to binary encoder using verilog.

AIM:

To Design and simulate octal to binary encoder using verilog.

INTRODUCTION:

The 8 to 3 line Encoder is also known as Octal to Binary Encoder.
In 8 to 3 line encoder, there is a total of eight inputs, i.e., Y0, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5, Y6, and Y7 and three outputs, i.e., A0, A1, and A2.
In 8-input lines, one input-line is set to true at a time to get the respective binary code in the output side.
Below are the block diagram and the truth table of the 8 to 3 line encoder.

EXPLANATION:

8 to 3-bit priority encoder is an encoder that consists of 8 input lines and 3 output lines.
It can also be called an Octal to a binary encoder.
Each input line has a base value of 8 (octal) and each output has a base value of 2 (binary).

PROGRAM:

module oc_bi_encoder(a0,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,y1,y2,y3);
input a0,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7;
output y1,y2,y3;
or(y1,a4,a5,a6,a7);
or(y2,a2,a3,a6,a7);
or(y3,a1,a3,a5,a7);
endmodule
